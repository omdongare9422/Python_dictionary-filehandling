# Python Dictionary File Handling Project

This project is a Python-based dictionary application that utilizes file handling techniques to store and manage words and their corresponding definitions. It offers functionalities to add new words, update existing definitions, and search for definitions efficiently.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `main.py` file to launch the dictionary application.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the dictionary.

## File Structure

- `dictionary.py`: Contains the main logic for adding, updating, and searching for definitions.
- `operations.py`: Implements file handling operations such as reading and writing to the dictionary file.
- `main.py`: Entry point of the application; executes the dictionary interface.

## Usage

The application provides a simple user interface for managing the dictionary:

- **Add Word**: Allows users to add new words and their definitions to the dictionary.
- **Update Definition**: Enables users to update the definitions of existing words.
- **Search Word**: Facilitates searching for the definition of a specific word.

## File Descriptions

- `dictionary.json`: JSON file used to store the dictionary data.
- `__pycache__/`: Directory containing cached Python bytecode files.
